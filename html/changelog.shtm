    <h3>2015-01-18 new version 1.7.7 released</h3>
    <hr />
    <h4>New functionality:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
Because SHA1 is widely phased out, WebCert changed the CSR and certificate generation signing to SHA256.
      </li>
      <li>
WebCert now handles Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for certificates and requests. Certificate requests can be build using the most common ECC key types secp224r1, secp256k1, secp384r1 and secp521r1.
      </li>
      <li>
Certificate requests now display the signature algorithm and data.
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2013-02-28 new version 1.7.6 released</h3>
    <hr />
    <h4>New functionality:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
Set specific certificate start and end dates: The certificate validity, in
 addition to being set as days valid from "now", can now also be set for
 specific start and end dates. This allows the creation of certs with a lifetime
 of minutes, create certs for future dates, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
Overhaul of display functions: cert requests and certificate data will now be
 available in both text and PEM format on one, single page. A simple
Javascript function will do the switching at the (browser) client side.
      </li>
      <li>
Update of the certificate validations page:
<p> The validation of remote servers will be able to display the details of
remotely received certificate chains, i.e. the intermediate and root certificates.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
A javascript print button for certificate requests, certificates and validation results has been added.
 A stylesheet and icons clean-up now provides a decent print image with "background" printing enabled.
      </li>
      <li>
For the online certificate request generation, expand the number of SubjectAltNames from two to four.
      </li>
      <li>
Documentation update: The "Help" section should get the missing instructions
 for the cert validation function. The "Installation" page is going to be updated as well.
      </li>
    <li>
Updating the HTML code to validate as "XHTML v1.0 transitional".
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Bug fixes:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixing several bugs in the results list navigation of certsearch.cgi.</li>
      <li>Update of time protection for the year 2038 integer overflow on 32bit systems.</li>
      <li>Do not create duplicate extensions:
      <p>I.e. Java keytool-generated CRS's already contain the "subject Key Identifier" extension</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2012-10-08 new version 1.7.5 released</h3>
    <hr />
    <h4>New functionality:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
New certificate validation function certvalidate.cgi allows the analysis of the signing chain.
      </li>
      <li>
Implementation of SubjectAltNames for creating multi-purpose certificates.
      </li>
      <li>
The obsolete "Netscape Comment" extension for server certificates has been removed.
      </li>
      <li>
Submitted certificate requests are now signed including their requested extensions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2011-06-20 new version 1.7.4 released</h3>
    <hr />
    <h4>New functionality:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
A html graphics layout overhaul has been done to better utilise external stylesheets.
      </li>
      <li>
Improved cross-browser compatibility: Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Chrome
      </li>
      <li>
Existing certificate request files can now be uploaded, in addition to copy and paste.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2010-11-10 new version 1.7.3 released</h3>
    <hr />
    <h4>New functionality:</h4>
    <p>
  Implementation of "Extended Key Usage" parameter to allow the creation
  of certificates that require it.  I needed it to generate certificates
  for Microsoft Windows to enable the active directory LDAPS function by
  adding the "SSL/TLS Web Server Authentication" extended key usage.
  At this time, only the extension values below have been implemented:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>serverAuth,      SSL/TLS Web Server Authentication OID=1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1</li>
      <li>clientAuth,      SSL/TLS Web Client Authentication OID=1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2</li>
      <li>codeSigning,     Code signing                      OID=1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3</li>
      <li>emailProtection, E-mail Protection (S/MIME)        OID=1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4</li>
      <li>timeStamping,    Trusted Timestamping              OID=1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.8</li>
      <li>ocspSigning,     Online Cert Status Protocol signing OID=1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.9</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
  I did not implement the OID's 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.5-7. They belong to id-kp-ipsecEndSystem,
  id-kp-ipsecTunnel and id-kp-ipsecUser and are reported to be obsolete
  as per RFC 4945 section 5.1.3.12,  "ExtendedKeyUsage".
    </p>
    <p>
  Regardless what the certificate request contains, the extended key usage
  must be always explicitly set at the request verification screen to be
  included in the certificate. Even if a externally generated request did
  not add this attribute, it can be set additionally with WebCert.
    </p>
    <h3>2008-03-20 	new version 1.7.2 released	</h3>
    <hr />
    <h4>Bug fix only:</h4>
    <ul>
<li>The nasty P12 export function still created a empty zero byte p12 file
 in cases when no private key was paste'd at all. I also added an extra
 comment that the private key file is really needed for pkcs12 export.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2007-12-20 	new version 1.7.1 released	</h3>
    <hr />
    <h4>Bug fix only:</h4>
    <ul>
<li>The P12 export function failed when a private key was paste'd with
 multiple trailing empty lines, creating a empty zero byte p12 file.</li>
<li>A link to a S/Mime certificate creation How-To was added to the help section.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2007-12-15 	new version 1.7.0 released	</h3>
    <hr />
    <h4>New functionality:</h4>
    <ul>
<li>Full support for generation of S/MIME certificates:
 <p>
 the new certexport.cgi convienently converts a existing PEM certificate
 into either DER or PKCS12 format. The files are copied into the export
 directory of the webcert web application.  In the case of PKCS12, the
 private key must be supplied in PEM format (cut&amp;paste), together with a
 passphrase for protection.</p></li>
<li>the certsearch.cgi function has been expanded to filter certificates by
 their serial number</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Bug fixes:</h4>
    <ul>
<li>The [Go Back] button in genrequest.cgi was pointing to certrequest.cgi
 instead of refering back to buildrequest.cgi.</li>
<li>The latest CGI definitions were missing in the top level Makefile</li>
<li>The REQLEN parameter was to small for certificates with a 4096 bit key</li>
<li>getcert.cgi had a minor display bug in the HTML table</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2007-10-15 	new version 1.6.0 released	</h3>
    <hr />
    <h4>New functionality:</h4>
    <ul>
<li>New certificate search function:
 <p>
To find particular certificates, the new certsearch.cgi can filter
  the cert store per subject field, validation or expiration date.
  This helps to identify certificates that are about to expire,
  and renew them before they become invalid.</p></li>
<li>For consistem look&amp;feel accross CGI's, the font has been set to
 Arial in all CGI's (certverify.cgi and genrequest.cgi)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2007-07-01 	new version 1.5.0 released	</h3>
    <hr />
    <h4>New functionality:</h4>
    <ul>
<li>Certificate Store display enhancements:
<p>
  certstore.cgi gets a new "Expiration" column, displaying how long the certificate is
  still valid. It is shown in days remaining and as a pseudo-graphical bar
  representing the percentage of time left, compared to the certificate
  lifetime. The selection to display a certificate either in PEM or TXT
  format has been added to certstore.cgi for quicker access.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Bug fixes:</h4>
    <ul>
<li>The certstore.cgi display fails to sort correctly if store has more then
  255 certificate files because alphasort fails when the .pem filename
  gets the next 2 digits added after FF.pem is reached (255).
  I wrote the hexsort function to correct that.</li>
<li>I fixed a minor display bug on the control panel in certstore.cgi, which
  is visible in Konqueror. Improved pixel count for displaying the bar.</li>
<li>Wrong page count for certstore.cgi: When the number of certs is
  divisible through the max. entries per page without remainder,
  meaning that all pages are filled to the max, a extra empty page was
  generated.</li>
<li>Compiler warnings complain about pointer targets differ in signedness:
  new compilers are so picky and warn about implicit data type promotion.
  I added explicit casting to avoid these errors.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2006-02-10      new version 1.4.0 released</h3>
    <hr />
    <h4>New functionality:</h4>
    <ul>
<li>Certificate key usage extensions can be set:
<p>
The correct combination is enabled by setting the certificate purpose:
 Client, Server, Signing, E-Mail</p></li>
<li>The certificate expiration can now be set:
<p>
  Expiration is a most convenient feature. Usually certificates
  are valid several years. IF you want to experiment with short
  validity, set valid days to 1.</p>
<p>
  Further visions: Imagine you want to give access to a
  resource using a client certificate that should expire with the
  end of a contract at a certain date. How about being able to 
  enter a start and end date similar to 'openssl ca -startdate -enddate'?</p></li>
<li>Display expired certificates in certstore.cgi list:
<p>
Expired certificates are marked red in the list by comparing their
  expiration date to the date of the webcert host.</p></li>
<li>WebCert has been verified to work with openssl-0.9.8a</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2005-06-25 	new version 1.3.0 released	</h3>
    <hr />
    <h4>New functionality:</h4>
    <ul>
<li>Implementation of the serial number management:
<p>
This is the base for further improvements. Now, certificates are not
 only displayed, but also saved in the /certs directory. The serial
 number serves as the file name in tradition with identical OpenSSL behaviour.</p></li>
<li>New forms for online certificate request generation:
<p>
New certificate requests are generated with buildrequest.cgi
 and genrequest.cgi, then forwarded for immediate signing. 
The form buildrequest.cgi is became the new entry page, while certrequest.cgi
 which handles the copy&amp;paste of existing PEM requests, got a new menu item
 on the top menu.</p></li>
<li>Re-design of certstore.cgi:
<p>
The certificate store CGI has been re-written to display the
 certificates sorted by creation time. Latest certs now appear
 first by default, and it can be switched to show oldest first, also.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Bug Fixes:</h4>
    <ul>
<li>certstore.cgi fails when certs are available in the certs directory,
  but the webserver has no rights to read it. Fix: When a cert is not
  readable, it is marked as not readable in the list.</li>
<li>Having a extra newline at the end of a cut&amp;paste certificate request
  results in a BEGIN/END lines error. Now the additional newline will
  be stripped off in certverify.cgi and certsign.cgi.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2004-03-09      new version 1.2.0 released      </h3>
    <hr />
    <h4>New functionality:</h4>
    <ul>
<li>Webcert has been re-written in 'C' for performance and portability:
<p>
 WebCert is now using the OpenSSL library API instead of being a front-end to the
 commandline tool. This radical design change supports future extension.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2003-06-30      new version 1.0.0 released      </h3>
    <hr />
    <h4>New functionality:</h4>
    <ul>
<li>Webcert has been written to provide a easy way for creating certificates:
<p>
Perl CGI's provide a web interface to take PEM-encoded certificate requests
 and return a signed certificate, using our newly created, internal OpenSSL CA.</p></li>
